This Weekly Challenge is the first code I have organized to follow semantic structure in HTML. Acting as a marketing agent, I needed to improve a codebase that followed accessibility standards in order to optimize search engine features. I am a complete beginner at this and hope to improve in time. Feedback is appreciated!
